title: Linear Types
---

This section explains Austral's linear type system. We begin with the
motivation: why do we need linear types? Then we explain what linear types are
and how they solve our problems.

# Resources and Lifecycles

Consider a file handling API:

```
type File

File openFile(String path)

File writeString(File file, String content)

void closeFile(File file)
```

An experienced programmer understands the _implicit lifecycle_ of the `File`
object:

1. We create a `File` handle by calling `openFile`.
2. We write to the handle zero or more times.
3. We close the file handle by calling `closeFile`.

We can depict this graphically like this:

![A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'.](/assets/spec/file-api.svg)

But, crucially: this lifecycle is _not enforced by the compiler_. There are a
number of erroneous transitions that we don't consider, but which are
technically possible:

![The graph from the previous figure, with a new node labeled 'leak', and with four new arrows in red: one from 'closeFile' to itself labeled 'double close', one from 'closeFile' to 'writeString' labeled 'use after close', one from 'openFile' to 'leak' labeled 'forgot to close', and one from 'writeString' to 'leak' also labeled 'forgot to close'.](/assets/spec/file-api-errors.svg)

These fall into two categories:

1. **Leaks:** we can forget to call `closeFile`, e.g.:

    ```
    let file = openFile("hello.txt")
    writeString(file, "Hello, world!")
    // Forgot to close
    ```

2. **Use-After-Close:** and we can call `writeString` on a `File` object that
   has already been closed:

   ```
   closeFile(file)
   writeString(file, "Goodbye, world!");
   ```

   And we can close the file handle after it has been closed:

   ```
   closeFile(file);
   closeFile(file);
   ```

In a short linear program like this, we aren't likely to make these
mistakes. But when handles are stored in data structures and shuffled around,
and the lifecycle calls are separated across time and space, these errors become
more common.

And they don't just apply to files. Consider a database access API:

```
type Db

Db connect(String host)

Rows query(Db db, String query)

void close(Db db)
```

Again: after calling `close` we can still call `query` and `close`. And we can
also forget to call `close` at all.

And --- crucially --- consider this memory management API:

```
type Pointer<T>

Pointer<T> allocate(T value)

T load(Pointer<T> ptr)

void store(Pointer<T> ptr, T value)

void free(Pointer<T> ptr)
```

Here, again, we can forget to call `free` after allocating a pointer, we can
call `free` twice on the same pointer, and, more disastrously, we can call
`load` and `store` on a pointer that has been freed.

Everywhere we have _resources_ --- types with an associated lifecycle, where
they must be created, used, and destroyed, in that order --- we have the same
kind of errors: forgetting to destroy a value, or using a value after it has
been destroyed.

In the context of memory management, pointer lifecycle errors are so disastrous
they have their own names:

1. [Double free errors](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory).
2. [Use-after-free errors](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Using_freed_memory).

Naturally, computer scientists have attempted to attack these problems. The
traditional approach is called _static analysis_: a group of PhD's will write a
program that goes through the source code and performs various checks and finds
places where these errors may occur.

Reams and reams of papers, conference proceedings, university slides, etc. have
been written on the use of static analysis to catch these errors. But the
problem with static analysis is threefold:

1. It is a moving target. While type systems are relatively fixed --- i.e., the
   type checking rules are the same across language versions --- static
   analyzers tend to change with each version, so that in each newer version of
   the software you get more and more sophisticated heuristics.

2. Like unit tests, it can usually show the _presence_ of bugs, but not their
   _absence_. There may be false positives --- code that is perfectly fine but
   that the static analyzer flags as incorrect --- but more dangerous is the
   false negative, where the static analyzer returns an all clear on code that
   has a vulnerability.

3. Static analysis is an opaque pile of heuristics. Because the analyses are
   always changing, the programmer is not expected to develop a mental model of
   the static analyzer, and to write code with that model in mind. Instead, they
   are expected to write the code they usually write, then throw the static
   analyzer at it and hope for the best.

What we want is a way to solve these problems that is _static_ and
_complete_. Static in that it is a fixed set of rules that you can learn once
and remember, like how a type system works. _Complete_ in that is has _no false
negatives_, and _every_ lifecycle error is caught.

And, above all: we want it to be simple, so it can be wholly understood by the
programmer working on it.

So, to summarize our requirements:

1. **Correctness Requirement:** We want a way to ensure that resources are used
   in the correct lifecycle.

2. **Simplicity Requirement:** We want that mechanism to be simple, that is, a
   programmer should be able to hold it in their head. This rules out
   complicated solutions involving theorem proving, SMT solvers, symbolic
   execution, etc.

3. **Staticity Requirement:** We want it to be a fixed set of rules and not an
   ever changing pile of heuristics.

All these goals are achievable: the solution is _linear types_.

# What Linear Types Are

Let's consider a linear file system API. We'll use a vaguely C++ like syntax,
but linear types are denoted by an exclamation mark after their name.

The API looks like this:

```
type File!

File! openFile(String path)

File! writeString(File! file, String content)

void closeFile(File! file)
```

The `openFile` function is fairly normal: takes a path and returns a linear
`File!` object.

`writeString` is where things are different: it takes a linear `File!` object
(and consumes it), and a string, and it returns a "new" linear `File!`
object. "New" is in quotes because it is a fresh linear value only from the
perspective of the type system: it is still a handle to the same file. But don't
think about the implementation too much: we'll look into how this is implemented
later.

`closeFile` is the destructor for the `File!` type, and is the terminus of the
lifecycle graph: a `File!` enters and does not leave, and the object is disposed
of. Let's see how linear types help us write safe code.

Can we leak a `File!` object? No:

```
let file: File! := openFile("sonnets.txt");
// Do nothing.
```

The compiler will complain: the variable `file` is used zero
times. Alternatively:

```
let file: File! := openFile("sonnets.txt");
writeString(file, "Devouring Time, blunt thou the lionâ€™s paws, ...");
```

The return value of `writeString` is a linear `File!` object, and it is being
silently discarded. The compiler will whine at us.

We can strike the "leak" transitions from the lifecycle graph:

![A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four black arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'. There are two red arrows: one from 'closeFile' to 'writeString' labeled 'use after close', and one from 'closeFile' to itself labeled 'double close'.](/assets/spec/file-api-without-leaks.svg)

Can we close a file twice? No:

```
let file: File! := openFile("test.txt");
closeFile(file);
closeFile(file);
```

The compiler will complain that you're trying to use a linear variable twice. So
we can strike the "double close" erroneous transition from the lifecycle graph:

![A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four black arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'. There is one red arrow: from 'closeFile' to 'writeString' labeled 'use after close'.](/assets/spec/file-api-without-leaks-and-double-close.svg)

And you can see where this is going. Can we write to a file after closing it?
No:

```
let file: File! := openFile("test.txt");
closeFile(file);
let file2: File! := writeString(file, "Doing some mischief.");
```

The compiler will, again, complain that we're consuming `file` twice. So we can strike the "use after close" transition from the lifecycle graph:

![A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'.](/assets/spec/file-api.png)

And we have come full circle: the lifecycle that the compiler enforces is
exactly, one-to-one, the lifecycle that we intended.

There is, ultimately, one and only one way to use this API such that the
compiler doesn't complain:

```
let f: File! := openFile("rilke.txt");
let f_1: File! := writeString(f, "We cannot know his legendary head\n");
let f_2: File! := writeString(f_1, "with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso\n");
...
let f_15: File! := writeString(f_14, "You must change your life.");
closeFile(f_15);
```

Note how the file value is "threaded" through the code, and each linear variable
is used exactly once.

And now we are three for three with the requirements we outlined in the previous
section:

1. **Correctness Requirement:** Is it correct? Yes: linear types allow us to
   define APIs in such a way that the compiler enforces the lifecycle perfectly.

2. **Simplicity Requirement:** Is it simple? Yes: the type system rules fit in a
   napkin. There's no need to use an SMT solver, or to prove theorems about the
   code, or do symbolic execution and explore the state space of the
   program. The linearity checks are simple: we go over the code and count the
   number of times a variable appears, taking care to handle loops and `if`
   statements correctly. And also we ensure that linear values can't be
   discarded silently.

3. **Staticity Requirement:** Is it an ever-growing, ever-changing pile of
   heuristics? No: it is a fixed set of rules. Learn it once and use it forever.

And does this solution generalize? Let's consider a linear database API:

```
type Db!

Db! connect(String host)

Pair<Db!, Rows> query(Db! db, String query)

void close(Db! db)
```

This one's a bit more involved: the `query` function has to return a tuple
containing both the new `Db!` handle, and the result set.

Again: we can't leak a database handle:

```
let db: Db! := connect("localhost");
// Do nothing.
```

Because the compiler will point out that `db` is never consumed. We can't `close` a database handle twice:

```
let db: Db! := connect("localhost");
close(db);
close(db); // error: `db` consumed again.
```

Because `db` is used twice. Analogously, we can't query a database once it's closed:

```
let db: Db! := connect("localhost");
close(db);
let (db1, rows): Pair<Db!, Rows> := query(db, "SELECT ...");
close(db); // error: `db` consumed again.
```

For the same reason. The only way to use the database correctly is:

```
let db: Db! := connect("localhost");
let (db1, rows): Pair<Db!, Rows> := query(db, "SELECT ...");
// Iterate over the rows or some such.
close(db1);
```

What about manual memory management? Can we make it safe? Let's consider a
linear pointer API, but first, we have to introduce some new notation. When you
have a generic type with generic type parameters, in a regular language you
might declare it like:

```
type T<A, B, C>
```

Here, we also have to specify which universe the parameters and the resulting
type belong to. Rember: there are two universes: free and linear. So for example
we can write:

```
type T<A: Free, B: Free>: Free
type U!<A: Linear>: Linear
```

But sometimes we want a generic type to accept type arguments from any
universe. In that case, we use `Type`:

```
type Pair<L: Type, R: Type>: Type;
```

This basically means: the type parameters `L` and `R` can be filled with types
from either universe, and the universe that `Pair` belongs to is determined by
said arguments:

1. If `A` and `B` are both `Free`, then `Pair` is `Free`.
2. If either one of `A` and `B` are `Linear`, then `Pair` is `Linear`.

Now that we're being explicit about universes, we can drop the exclamation mark
notation.

Here's the linear pointer API:

```
type Pointer<T: Type>: Linear;

generic <T: Type>
Pointer<T> allocate(T value)

generic <T: Type>
T deallocate(Pointer!<T> ptr)

generic <T: Free>
Pair<Pointer<T>, T> load(Pointer<T> ptr)

generic <T: Free>
Pointer<T> store(Pointer<T> ptr, T value)
```

This is more involved than previous examples, and uses new notation, so let's
break it down declaration by declaration.

1. First, we declare the `Pointer` type as a generic type that takes a parameter
   from any universe, and belongs to the `Linear` universe by fiat. That is:
   even if `T` is `Free`, `Pointer<T>` will be `Linear`.

   ```
   type Pointer<T: Type>: Linear;
   ```

2. Second, we define a generic function `allocate`, that takes a value from
   either universe, allocates memory for it, and returns a linear pointer to it.

   ```
   generic <T: Type>
   Pointer<T> allocate(T value)
   ```

3. Third, we define a slightly unusual `deallocate` function: rather than
   returning `void`, it takes a pointer, dereferences it, deallocates the
   memory, and returns the dereferenced value:

   ```
   generic <T: Type>
   T deallocate(Pointer!<T> ptr)
   ```

4. Fourth, we define a generic function specifically for pointers that contain
   free values: it takes a pointer, dereferences it, and returns a tuple with
   both the pointer and the dereferenced free value.

   ```
   generic <T: Free>
   (Pointer<T>, T) load(Pointer<T> ptr)
   ```

   Why does `T` have to belong to the `Free` universe? Because otherwise we
   could write code like this:

   ```
   // Suppose that `L` is a linear type.
   let p: Pointer<L> := allocate(...);
   let (p2, val): Pair<Pointer<L>, L> := load(p);
   let (p3, val2): Pair<Pointer<L>, L> := load(p2);
   ```

   Here, we've allocated a pointer to a linear value, but we've loaded it from
   memory twice, effectively duplicating it. This obviously should not be
   allowed. So the type parameter `T` is constrained to take only values of the
   `Free` universe, which can be copied freely any number of times.

5. Fifth, we define a generic function, again for pointers that contain free
   values. It takes a pointer and a free value, and stores that value in the
   memory allocated by the pointer, and returns the pointer again for reuse:

   ```
   generic <T: Free>
   Pointer<T> store(Pointer<T> ptr, T value)
   ```

   Again: why can't this function be defined for linear values? Because then we
   could write:

   ```
   // Suppose `L` is a linear type, and `a` and b`
   // are variables of type `L`.
   let p1: Pointer<L> := allocate(a);
   let p2: Pointer<L> := store(p1, b);
   let l: L := deallocate(p2);
   ```

   What happens to `a`? It is overwritten by `b` and lost. For values in the
   `Free` universe this is no problem: who cares if a byte is overwritten? But
   we can't overwrite linear values -- like database handles and such -- because
   the they would be leaked.

It is trivial to verify the safety properties. We can't leak memory, we can't
deallocate twice, and we can't read or write from and to a pointer after it has
been deallocated.

# What Linear Types Provide

Linear types give us the following benefits:

1. Manual memory management without memory leaks, use-after-`free`, double
   `free` errors, garbage collection, or any runtime overhead in either time or
   space other than having an allocator available.

2. More generally, we can manage _any_ resource (file handles, socket handles,
   etc.) that has a lifecycle in a way that prevents:

   1. Forgetting to dispose of that resource (e.g.: leaving a file handle open).
   2. Disposing of the resource twice (e.g.: trying to free a pointer twice).
   3. Using that resource after it has been disposed of (e.g.: reading from a
      closed socket).

   All of these errors are prevented _statically_, again without runtime
   overhead.

3. In-place optimization: the APIs we have looked at resemble functional
   code. We write code "as if" we were creating and returning new objects with
   each call, while doing extensive mutations under the hood. This gives us the
   benefits of functional programming (referential transparency and equational
   reasoning) with the performance of imperative code that mutates data wildly.

4. Safe concurrency. A value of a linear type, by definition, has only one
   owner: we cannot duplicate it, therefore, we cannot have multiple owners
   across threads. So imperative mutation is safe, since we know that no other
   thread can write to our linear value while we work with it.

5. Capability-based security: suppose we want to lock down access to the
   terminal. We want there to be only one thread that can write to the terminal
   at a time. Furthermore, code that wants to write to the terminal needs
   permission to do so.

   We can do this with linear types, by having a linear `Terminal` type that
   represents the capability of using the terminal. Functions that read and
   write from and to the terminal need to take a `Terminal` instance and return
   it. We'll discuss capability based security in greater detail in a future
   section.
